# User ReadMe

Download the zip for the repository and inside the folder named "program" the EXE file named "TAsceduler.exe" can be found.

To use the program launch it with the TAscheduler.exe

You must enter both a Student.csv file and a Schedule.csv file which MUST have the names student and schedule respectively to ensure that inputs are appropriate. 
You open up the file explorer to grab these files by clicking on the Student.csv button or the Schedule.csv button. 

You then need to press run. When the program is complete the Bottom right text box will display “Program is Complete”.
When the program is finished a new CSV file will be placed within the same folder as the TAscheduler.exe file called “TA_Assignment_File.csv”


# Notes and current bugs

- If One or more required csv files are not inputted then the program will output an empty csv file.
- If there is already a csv file named “TA_Assignment_File.csv” in the same directory as the exe file it will be overwritten.
- The student and scheduler files need to be formatted in a specific way otherwise it will not work
