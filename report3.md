# Report 3

## How do you test things and what did you find 
To test our algorithm, we created a number of unit tests to make sure that the subroutines are working as intended. We also created new CSV files to test our program against different scenarios. For instance, in the cases where there is only one student available to TA a class or when there are no available students to TA any classes. From our unit tests, we can conclude that our subroutines are working as intended. From testing our algorithm with new data, we found that our algorithm does not take into consideration the location of the students. Our algorithm does correctly assign students to classes with experience requirements, but it does not use the experiences columns to do so. We do not believe that this is a problem since a student will not be assigned to a class that they have not taken.Thus, there should not be a scenario where a student is assigned to a class they are unqualified to TA for.
 
## What prototypes did you make 
In our original design we had a simple console based application that allowed the user to put the student and schedule csv files in the directory with the program and run it through an IDE. However, we came to a realization that this method has some issues; if the user put files that were misnamed or only put in a single file then the program would fail to run. 
We wanted to make something that anyone could use, not just someone familiar with running code through an IDE. Pivoting from the hard coded method we originally went with, we are now implementing a user GUI. This GUI will contain three buttons; The first button will be clicked on to import a student csv file. The second button will be clicked on to import the schedule csv file. The third button will run the program and output a new csv file into the program directory. 
After our initial interface was implemented we realized that the program did not contain any identifiers when the run button was clicked and a user could not tell if the program did anything. It was then decided to add additional dialog boxes to the interface. The first box contains instructions on how to use the program. The second box contains a message telling the user that when the program is finished running it will be updated with a message saying it is done.
 
## Short summary of what you did so far, what problems you encountered. 
There have been two completed prototypes of our algorithm so far. The first iteration had some critical flaws that were discovered through our many unit tests. The first iteration assigned students to classes they have taken before and chose students who were the closest to graduation when choosing between students. However, it did not take into account that some classes are listed multiple times in the schedule file with multiple sections and so TAâ€™s were being assigned to classes that did not have a listed time. We caught this in our unit test that showed only the first 21 (out of 45 total) Schedule objects received assignments, which did not include any upper division courses. Another issue was that assignments in the first iteration did not take into account student availability during the time that a class is offered, so some assignments were invalid because the student is not actually free during that time. 
In the first iteration, assignments were done by keeping track of a class index in a private array. This proved to be a fundamental problem once classes with multiple sections were considered. We had to change our assignment process to work with the objects directly whereas before we were working with passing index values to reference specific classes or students. In order to change our assignments to work only with objects and how our objects interact with each other, we had to slightly change/add some fields in our two objects. Primarily, the biggest change was how we stored the days and time of a Schedule object. The way we stored this info needed to change in order to have a way to check if a student is available during a class time. 
Our second iteration, and the current version that is pushed to GitHub, takes into account the students availability in the assignment process and does not assign students to classes that do not have listed times.
## What is the current state of your project, and what you plan to do next.
We have gone into the stage of testing and debugging. As of right now we have a working demo with a simple implementation of the project that assigning students into class taking in consideration their graduation and availability, but we have not yet implement a check for things such as their skills in certain languages, whether they live in Ellensburg, or differentiate between 392 and 492 students. These will soon be implemented and tested once we figured out some of the issues we have with the current build.
We have also moved on to making a user interface for the program to print out the assignments instead of having the user call the executable from the command line. The program will be packaged in a neat installable package that requires no installation of Java or the other library we used for the UI. We still need to merge the interface with the code we currently have which will take some time.
