# Report 1 - Feasibility

## What tools & technology do you use? 

For this project our objective is to make it so that it is accessible and easy to use. The scope of the project is manageable, the input a list of classes and a list of students in form of CSV files. We will use Java because Java is a hybrid language that can be compiled into Java opcode and packaged with the runtime program to run on any operating system that supports Java. Write once, run anywhere. The interface will be terminal, and require little to no 3rd party library.This simple input and output program will be packaged into a .exe or Unix executable with Launch4j to be run without any set up on the preferred Operating System.

## How do you plan to organize things? 

Weâ€™ll use github as our code repository. At the time, we decided not to use a dedicated team management tool like trello or Monday.com. This will likely change once we have a more solid idea of the features that need to be developed. Communications will be done via Discord. 


## What do you need from the client?

We would like the client to provide more details about the format of the file. Specifically in regards to how information is presented inside the file as well as what type of information is provided about the students and classes.


## Give a short summary of what you did so far, what is the current state of your project, and what you plan to do next.

We have gone over plans of initiation where we discussed various ways to complete the project and have decided to implement the project with Java. We have researched that Java will indeed support inputting and outputting CSV file types. As our project is still in early development stages our current thought process is that we will use an incremental developing and continuous delivery strategy since the requirements will change over time, but this could change as we move forward. This project as of now will also be a console application which takes in text commands. We have written up a couple pseudo code mock-ups to see what kinds of functions we will use but will need further information from the client to decide on a final approach.

The next step for us is to get client information on how the CSV file is formatted for the TA information. After, we can finalize which functions are needed and assign team members to work on specific functions and get a working prototype out.
